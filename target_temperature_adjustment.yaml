  name: Target temperature adjustment depending on second temperature sensor
  description: >
    Sets target temperature depending on second temperature sensor.
    This blueprint is inspired by this blueprint https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tado-set-offset-using-separate-temperature-sensor/288515
    created by Sanderma. Since not all thermostat devices have an configurable
    offset, this blueprint sets the target temperature of the thermostat device
    depending on a given target temperature and a second temperature sensor.
